Problem: Find Peak Element

Problem Statement:
A peak element in an array is an element that is strictly greater
 than its neighbors.

Given an integer array nums, find a peak element, and 
return its index. 
If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of
the peaks.

You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.

Input:
An integer array nums.

Output:
The index of the peak element.

Example:
Input:
nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output:
2
